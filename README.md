<h3>Description<h3>
When used in conjunction with one of the many recently released Touch-ID application security tweaks<br />
such as BioLockdown, BioProtect, etc., 1Pass will allow you to securely launch the 1Password application<br />
on your iPhone without having to enter your master passcode.<br />
<br />
Your master passcode will be stored securely within the iOS Keychain, allowing you maintain application<br />
security via the Touch-ID sensor.<br />
